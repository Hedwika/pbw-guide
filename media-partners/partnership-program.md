We are open to partnerships with anyone who would like to regularly report on the events that will take place during Prague Blockchain Week. It doesn't matter if you are a classic media house, a cryptocurrency news site, or an independent journalist or podcaster.

Based on the agreement, media partners will have the following benefits:

* membership in a private group exclusively for media partners
* "press tickets" for individual events
* access to the temporary [Press Center](partnership-program.md#press-center-wip) during #PBW23

## Press Center (WIP)

We are working on choosing a suitable venue, it should be easily accessible by taxi and public transport. Information and technical service will be available on site. The Press Centre should be open every day during the whole Prague Blockchain Week, i.e. 2-11 June.

### Facilities

* quiet place to meet guests, networking or to work
* super-fast internet connection
