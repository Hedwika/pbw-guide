# ðŸ«‚ Event Unions

{% hint style="danger" %}
Event unions is a completely new concept - this experiment can still be cancelled at any time.
{% endhint %}

Event unions are voluntary groups of individual #PBW23 events, based on some mutual proximity. They usually have a common goal, coordinated by a responsible person or organisation, which should bring additional benefits - both for the organisers and for the visitors themselves.
