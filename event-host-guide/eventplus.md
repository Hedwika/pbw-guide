# âž• PBW23 Event+

Anyone can join Prague Blockchain Week by [hosting their own event](./) in the dates 2-11 June 2023. Independently and without cooperation with us.

However, as an additional option for event organizers, we offer the possibility of an extended partnership with PBW23, called **PBW23 Event+** (EventPlus). This service can give your event more visibility and better connection to the rest of the week, as well as other benefits.

If you are interested in participating in the PBW23 Event+ program, please [contact us](../contact-us.md).

## Benefits for your event

* stronger marketing within PBW23 social networks and other channels
* direct access to and cooperation with our partners
* your logo on PBW23 printed materials such as rollups or information stands
* bigger visibility at the PBW23 info-points in the centre of Prague
* placement of the PBW23 information stand(s) at your event
* extra services for your speakers or other key people - travel & accommodation recommendations, a stand at the airport, etc.
