# üìã Event Checklist

Please [define your event](define-your-event.md) (purpose and audience) and your attendee target before going through this checklist.

Please submit a proposal to [GitHub](https://github.com/utxo-foundation/pbw23) as soon as possible.

<details>

<summary>VENUE</summary>

* [ ] Pick a date and time for event.
* [ ] Determine the length of the event.
  * Build time in 1-4 hours for set up and breakdown depending on the size of your event.
* [ ] Determine how many people you want to attend.
  * Be realistic since there are many events going on during Prague Blockchain Week. It is better to book a smaller venue and fill it than book a larger venue and have it feel empty.
* [ ] Source and select a venue. Think co-working spaces, restaurants or spaces unique to Prague!
  * On the [Venue Options](venue-options.md) page you can find our recommended venues.

TIP: Venues with one entrance/exit are always preferred for security reasons and full buy out is ideal so that you are not sharing the space with another event. If the venue is outdoors, make sure there is a contingency plan in case of bad weather.
